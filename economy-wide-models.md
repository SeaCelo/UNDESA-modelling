# Economy-wide models

Economy-wide models are useful to assess “what-if” scenarios involving a variety of policies and shocks. They can shed light on the impacts of policies and shocks on employment, output, national budgets, imports and exports, and consumption patterns, among others.

Examples of policies assessed by the models include: increasing investments in education and health, investments in infrastructure, introduction of fuel or carbon taxes, and emissions cap regulations.
