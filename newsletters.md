The newsletters focus on providing updates about UNDESA's capacity-building activities using macroeconomic and policy simulation models to strengthen national recovery strategies and sustainable development efforts in various countries. Recent initiatives include workshops and model introductions in South Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as part of a project funded by the UN Peace and Development Fund. These activities aim to equip government agencies with quantitative tools for data-driven decision-making. Additionally, the newsletter covers progress in CLEWs modeling in Namibia, supporting the National Development Plan with policy scenario analysis, and the collaboration between UNDESA and ESCWA to implement the World Economic Forecasting Model in Jordan and Tunisia, advancing sustainable finance and SDGs.
