# Geo-spatial Electrification

The Open Source Spatial Electrification Tool (OnSSET) uses geospatial data to determine the most cost-effective conventional and renewable energy technologies for bringing electricity to specific localities. It is designed to identify means of providing access to safe, affordable and reliable electricity to households that currently do not have it. The model compares options such as connections to the electrical grid, and mini-grid or stand-alone systems. It factors in population density, distance to transmission and road networks, renewable energy potential, fuel prices and estimated electricity consumption per household, among other considerations.
